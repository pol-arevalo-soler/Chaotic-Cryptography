# Chaotic-Cryptography
In this work we study the Lorenz system and its application in the field of cryptography. 

We implement algorithms (in C) to encrypt and decrypt signals using the Lorenz system and analyze the dependence that exists between the error committed when recovering the original signal and the same signal. To do this, we use analytical and numerical tools that are presented in the code folder.
